    <p>RERUM was born in the <a href="https://blog.ongcdh.org/">
            Walter J. Ong, <small>S.J.</small> Center for Digital Humanities</a> at Saint Louis
        University and is (currently) completely funded and maintained by the
        fine folks on their retirement plan. This site is meant to be used by
        developers and programmers who need a good place to put some data and
        prefer that it be a public place that is not too expensive.</p>
    <p>Our goal is to raise the quality of and participation in open academic
        data by lowering the effort and cost of initializing a solution for
        data storage and management while making interoperability, standards
        compliance, and attribution automatic.</p>
    <p>There is no express warranty or license on either the data or these
        services, but on our word, this site will not die, the locations will
        not change without notification to participants. Each tool will allow
        you to walk away with all your data, exactly as stored.</p>

        We make an effort to stay interesting on <a href="https://blog.ongcdh.org/tag/rerum/">our blog</a>
        and invite you to make comments or ask questions there. It is not always about
        Rerum, but the topics reliably orbit the digital humanities and our work.
