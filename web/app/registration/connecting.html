    <h1>Connecting to RERUM</h1>
    <p>
        To limit the possibility of abuse without putting too many obstacles up,
        writing to the annotation store is restricted to registered servers (no CORS).
        This may not be permanent, but the full plans for RERUM can be found
        <a href="#/future">elsewhere on the site</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The current public iteration of RERUM (the annotation store) is hosted on
        a virtual server in OngCDH at Saint Louis University.
        The backend is written in Java and MongoDB, with all requests currently over
        HTTP.
    </p>
    <p>
        All read requests (GET) are open by default. To write to RERUM, you require
        a registered server that is capable of using the API correctly. It may be
        helpful to see the sample implementation of
