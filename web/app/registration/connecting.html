    <h1>Connecting to RERUM</h1>
    <p>
        To limit the possibility of abuse without putting too many obstacles up,
        writing to the annotation store is restricted to servers (no CORS) who have
        registered their IP (no ranges or named referrers). This is not permanent,
        but the full plans for RERUM can be found <a href="#/future">elsewhere on the site</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The current public iteration of the RERUM annotation store is hosted on
        a virtual server in the development area of OngCDH at Saint Louis University.
        The backend is written in Java and MongoDB, with all requests currently over
        HTTP.
    </p>
    <p>
        All read requests (GET) are open by default. To write to RERUM, Follow
        these simple steps:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Ensure your requests are all coming from a single server or proxy and
            <a target="_blank" href="#register">
                register the IP address.
            </a>
            here in RERUM.  
        </li>
        <li>
            Follow the API (<a href="#api">API page</a>) to create a new object or
            update an existing one and you will receive the location of the new
            object in the response. Your registered information is stored with
            all successful writes to the annotation store.
        </li>
    </ol>
