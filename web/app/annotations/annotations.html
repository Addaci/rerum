        The Open Annotation Collaboration broke important ground on
        08 February 2013, when they specified an interoperable framework
        for creating associations between related resources, annotations,
        using a methodology that conforms to the Architecture of the World
        Wide Web.<sup>

        The next year, SharedCanvas (now within IIIF), demonstrated
        how simply <abbr title="Open Annotation Collaboration">OAC</abbr> could be
        extended to point to complex objects.

    <p>
        Pointing, instead of directly encoding annotations and
        <dfn title="comments, edits, links...">annotation-like objects</dfn>
        provides benefits for scholarship by separating the resource from
        the annotation, allowing for more granular and irregular resources,
        and creating a clearer history of the academic conversation.
        By separating the resource (text, image, etc.) from the
        annotation, the original digitized resource remains pristine and
        can be located anywhere in the world. Selectors remove the need
        for every reference to be to a complete resource while also
        allowing a scholar to make a very specific annotation on a
        smaller range of the original resource, whether or not it
        has native segmentation within it. Finally, every annotation
        can be individually attributed to the asserting scholar and
        software, which makes filtering and walking back through the
        revisions a simpler process.
