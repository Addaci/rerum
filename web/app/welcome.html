        <em>Rerum</em> (Latin: "of things") is a conveniently ambiguous umbrella term we use to identify the
        <em>things</em> (tools, components, schemata) that are functional or philosophical kin to each other. The
        <abbr title="last universal common ancestor">LUCA</abbr>
        concept for them all is a set of principles:
        <dl>
            <dt><i class="fa fa-globe"></i> Annotation is everywhere</dt>
            <dd>
                Scholarly assertions, descriptive annotations, and even the measurements and notes often
                <a href="blogpost">mistaken for metadata</a>
                are all possible vertices for standards like Web Annotation. These sorts of declarations should 
                always be atomized as much as possible in their storage, especially when they are simple to 
                recombine for user applications.
            </dd>
            <dt><i class="fa fa-user"></i> Attribution is essential</dt>
            <dd>
                Productive communication between researchers requires reliable attribution. When individual 
                annotations (as above) are each attributed, collaboration becomes natural, and even complex 
                concerns such as authorization are just acts of filtering.
            </dd>
            <dt><i class="fa fa-floppy-o"></i> Format is ephemeral</dt>
            <dd>
                No one can predict the Next Great Format, but history can teach us about what obstacles to 
                migration can be avoided. The simpler it is to abandon, the more likely a format will 
                remain accessible.

RERUM = the application (any application) that runs a repository with the Rerum API. Rerum API = the set path formats and
list of equivalencies that are accepted for types. RERUM Server = the github project with a Java backend and MongoDB that
(will) respond to the Rerum API Rerum Cloud = the github project that connects the Rerum API to the Google Cloud Services.
Rerum Tools = standalone tools for editing objects and writing into and out of a RERUM Rerum User Management = the theoretical
SSO solution for WJOSJCDHSLU projects
