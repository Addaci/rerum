        <em>Rerum</em> (Latin: "of things") is a conveniently ambiguous umbrella term we use to identify the
        <em>things</em> (tools, schemata, databases) that are functional or philosophical kin. The
        <abbr title="last universal common ancestor">LUCA</abbr>
        concept for them all is a set of principles:
        <dl>
            <dt>
                 Annotation is everywhere</dt>
            <dd>
                <i class="fa fa-3x u-pull-left fa-globe"></i> Scholarly assertions, descriptive annotations, and even the measurements and notes often
                <a href="blogpost">mistaken for metadata</a>
                are all possible vertices for standards like Web Annotation. These sorts of declarations should always be atomized as much
                as possible in their storage, especially when they are simple to recombine for user applications.
            </dd>
            <dt>
                 Attribution is essential</dt>
            <dd>
                <i class="fa fa-3x u-pull-left fa-user"></i> Productive communication between researchers requires reliable attribution. When individual annotations (as above) are each
                attributed, collaboration becomes natural, and even complex concerns such as authorization are just acts
                of filtering.
            </dd>
            <dt>
                 Format is ephemeral</dt>
            <dd>
                <i class="fa fa-3x u-pull-left fa-floppy-o"></i> No one can predict the Next Great Format, but history can teach us about what obstacles to migration can be avoided. The
                simpler it is to abandon, the more likely a format will remain accessible.
            </dd>
            <dt>
                 Knowledge is controversy</dt>
            <dd>
                <i class="fa fa-3x u-pull-left fa-code-fork"></i> Statements of fact are reference material until challenged. The interaction of experts and the collisions of theories, evidence,
                and educated conjecture or theses enlivens research. Recording both the state and the history of the conversation
                serves knowledge.

            <dt>

            <dd>
                <i class="fa fa-3x u-pull-left fa-users"></i> Experts in any mature field are not only distributed across institutions, but the most influential investigators may move
                around, as people do. The complex and enforced conventions around citation and
                <abbr title="Intellectual Property Rights">IPR</abbr> make clear the critical nature of maintaining attribution and encouraging distribution.

        <dd>

        <dt>RERUM Server</dt>
        <dd>
            is a complete web service. Our existing instance is on github and combines MongoDB and Java.

        <dt>Rerum Cloud</dt>
        <dd>
            is an ongoing attempt to implement a cloud-based RERUM Server. The current github attempt uses Google Cloud Services.
