    <h1>The Future</h1>
    <p>
        The development efforts around RERUM fall into four categories:
        server, API, standards, and tools.
    </p>
    <h3>Server</h3>
    <p>
        The alpha server for the RERUM annotation store is a MongoDB/Java service
        (<a href="https://github.com/CenterForDigitalHumanities/rerum_server" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-github"></i></a>),
        but there is no reason the same server APIs cannot be implemented
        in other configurations so that users may easily initialize their own
        RERUM to which others may connect.
    </p>
    <p>
        Cloud services are the most obvious next step and there is already a project
        started (<a href="https://github.com/CenterForDigitalHumanities/rerum-cloud" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-github"></i></a>)
        using NodeJS and Google Datastore. Azure, AWS and others may be developed as well.
        Database flavors may be changed for different instances to optimize
        the transactions in RERUM or increase its adoption. There are SQL and noSQL
        or even flat file structures that may be best suited to certain resources.
    </p>
    <p>
        The current authentication is based on a simple IP whitelist. This requires
        servers to maintain a static IP and makes management clumsy. The use of an
        API key will improve the experience for developers and some work has begun
        on the GCS RERUM instance, implementing the Auth0 service. Furthermore,
        RERUM currently trusts the registered servers (and always will), but
        attribution will improve if the <a target="_blank" href="https://auth0.com">Auth0</a>
        authentication is extended to clients, not for API calls directly, but
        for the creation of public <code>Agent</code> objects, which can be tracked
        and managed in the OngCDH RERUM instance. Once this is in place, it will
        even be possible to extend authentication to individual users and allow
        applications to use the API to use a RERUM SSO, instead of tracking users
        internally.
    </p>
    <p>
        RERUM will pursue functionality as an authenticator for OngCDH
        applications and open it up for others. In addition to an instance of
        the Auth0 user management, RERUM will create a public user
        <code>foaf:Agent</code> that can provide a connection between various
        user profiles and be used as an aggregating value for attribution.
    </p>
    <p>
        Finally, modularization and export of the RERUM software will require
        attention. Dockers, Node modules, and others (bower, yeoman, gulp, grunt)
        may allow for custom configurations or just a simplified build for developers
        who wish to host their own instance. When these installs proliferate as hoped,
        it will also become important to spec out how they may identify each other to
        complete the graph and allow for broader queries and interconnections across
        the Internet.
    </p>

    <h3>API</h3>
    <p>
        All instances of RERUM repositories must allow for at least the core API documented on
        <a href="https://github.com/CenterForDigitalHumanities/rerum_server" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-github"></i> Github</a>.
        Version 0 is currently in use and suffers from several unconventional structures
        and a somewhat complex object structure. Version 1, being developed with the GCS RERUM
        instance, will attempt to standardize the object structure and remove the model
        requirement from the objects saved. Also, v1 will prefer JSON(-LD) for all
        transactions. Version 2, being designed, but not yet encoded anywhere, will
        focus on extending the search capabilities and accommodate interconnected
        RERUM servers.
    </p>

    <h3>Standards</h3>
    <p>
        RERUM would not be productive without the hard work of the Open Annotation
        Collaboration and the International Image Interoperability Framework. We
        believe this is the beginning of the story and the OAC model for annotation
        as description, connection, attribution, selection, aggregation, and more
        should be extended to audio, video, text, and other data formats where annotation
        and selection are improved with the implementation of an abstract digital
        surrogate. Through the democratization and productive use of annotation,
        this service intends to encourage the use of existing standards and the careful
        extension and development for better coverage of new areas of scholarship.
        <a href="https://centerfordigitalhumanities.github.io/rerum-consortium" target="_blank">The Rerum Consortium</a>
        exists, then, to provide a collaborative place for these new ideas to develop
        and take hold.
    </p>
    <p>
        While it would be nice for RERUM to automatically know what is new and hot,
        the real world often requires a lot of refactoring of old data and logical
        polyfills to allow for the gears of convention to match teeth with the cutting
        edge. In addition to regularly updating to include equivalents or converters
        for terms and formats that may rise and fall, the plan is to include many
        management tools as well for the regular validation, batch editing, and
        perhaps wholesale conversion of annotations.
    </p>

    <h3>Tools</h3>
    <p>
        In service to the mission, tools must be supported and referenced which make
        object creation easier, more accurate, and with which more encoding is possible
        than may be the minimum required for the motivating task. Here at rerum.io,
        we will maintain annotated references to external tools as well as producing
        tools ourselves.
    </p>
    <p>
        Use cases or requests for new tools can be submitted on the Rerum repository
        as <a href="https://github.com/CenterForDigitalHumanities/rerum/issues?title=Request%3A%20&body=Thanks%20for%20contributing%21">issues
            <i class="fa fa-github"></i></a>.
        Individual repositories will be generated for each OngCDH tool.
    </p>
    <p>
        Manifest tools are very important for smaller institutions and individuals.
        The focus in this area will be to create or reference tools that allow for
        viewing, creation, editing, and validation of <code>sc:Manifest</code> objects.
        Our tools will be web applications, but there is space for contributions of
        specific scripts shims and plug-ins for other applications. All tools hosted
        here will include the option to save your objects to RERUM by default.
    </p>
    <p>
        Annotation tools must be included and will become more various and specialized
        as RERUM matures. The specific challenge of a good annotation tool is not its
        ability to encode the standard OAC format, but its ability to identify its
        audience and encourage the user to make scholarly decisions without technical
        effort or improper encoding. Cropping a <code>sc:Canvas</code> image annotation
        is a very discrete act from marking illustrations, though much of the interactions
        are similar. Transcription is high on the list (OngCDH's bias), but any image
        annotation is supportable. Managing annotations is also a challenge and complete
        interfaces will be required to sensibly aggregate the records within RERUM for
        the users who use them. Traversing relationships and history will be a priority
        after simple queries are well-managed. Finally, viewing annotations out of
        context can be challenging, so small visualizations as well as code snippets
        in various front-end languages will be provided.
    </p>
    <p>
        Integration is not really a tool, but will become a list of tools within which
        resources from RERUM can be imported or referenced. These short links may provide
        the opportunity to begin a project in FromThePage using the connected Manifest
        or open an annotation management tool within a Collection at the Wellcome Library.
