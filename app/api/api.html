    <p>This is not ready to go yet, but the
        short version is that we provide several
        endpoints for creating, updating, or
        reading any object in the database from
        any registered server.</p>
    <p>All objects are sent and returned as
        JSON-LD objects, for the time being.
        They are stored as objects in a MongoDB
        with query access to find unique objects
        or discover relationships.</p>
    <p>Creating any new object will return
        to you the permanent location (URI) at
        which it will live and be versioned.</p>
