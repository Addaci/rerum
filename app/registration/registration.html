        <span class="thanks">We are so glad you are interested in using Saint Louis University's annotation store, RERUM</span>
        <br><br>
            RERUM authenticates only with a whitelist of application servers which
            in turn are expected to verify their own contributions. The provenance of
            each new annotation or object is marked with the server from which it came.
            Supply any label you would like stored with your IP address (because RERUM doesn't want to think of everyone as just a number).
            The IP must be a static IP.  If the IP address registered with the web application or server changes, you will have to register
            the new IP again.  If using several, please complete this form several times.
    </p>
