    <p>RERUM is a product of the Center for Digital Humanities at Saint Louis
        University and is (currently) completely funded and maintained by the
        fine folks on their retirement plan. This site is meant to be used by
        developers and programmers who need a good place to put some data and
        prefer that it be a public place that is not too expensive.</p>
    <p>Our goal is to provide a simple, out-of-the box connection that reduces
        concerns and costs about data storage and management while making
        interoperability, standards compliance, and attribution automatic.</p>
    <p>We currently are running several projects - private and public -
        %LIST_NOT_FOUND% that rely on RERUM for its back-end storage, so as we
        generate new tools to make that easier, they will be included here.</p>
    <p>There is no express warranty or license on either the data or these
        services, but on our word, this site will not die, the locations will not
        change without notification to participants. Moreover, some of the first
        tools will allow you to walk away with all your data, exactly as stored.</p>
